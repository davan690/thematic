```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

`thematic_on()` works everywhere in **rmarkdown** so long as you specify the colors and fonts ([rendering Google Fonts](#gfont-rendering) may require some additional setup, though). When it comes to auto detection, there are 3 situations where it _can_ work:

1. A `runtime: shiny` document where plots are generated via `renderPlot()` (or `renderImage`).
2. An output format that builds on `html_document_base()` with a non-`NULL` `theme`.
3. Other output formats that call `auto_config_set()` for you.


## Auto detection in `html_document`

Auto detection of colors and fonts is (partially) supported for  output formats that build on `html_document_base()` with a non-`NULL` `theme`, for example:

````md
---
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: darkly
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
library(thematic)
thematic_on()
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### ggplot

```{r}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, label = rownames(mtcars), color = factor(cyl))) +
        geom_point() +
        ggrepel::geom_text_repel()
```

### lattice

```{r}`r ''`
lattice::show.settings()
```

### base

```{r}`r ''`
image(volcano, col = thematic_get_option("sequential"))
```
````

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/KewYfYq.gif")
```

Partial support in this case means that auto detection doesn't support custom CSS, but it will detect equivalent styling performed via **bootstraplib**. For example, auto detection wouldn't be able to pick up on custom CSS like this in your document:

```html
<style> 
  body{font-family: Pacifico} 
</style>
```

However, if you instead style the document via **bootstraplib** code inside the document, then auto detection can pick up on that custom styling (see [here](https://rstudio.github.io/bootstraplib/articles/recipes.html) for more info on styling via **bootstraplib**):

```r
bootstraplib::bs_theme_fonts("Pacifico")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/eWXYtis.gif")
```


## Rendering Google Fonts {#gfont-rendering}

Rendering Google Fonts in **rmarkdown** requires either **showtext** or **ragg** to be installed. **showtext** works with **rmarkdown**'s default graphics devices, so make sure it's installed to render Google Fonts on those devices in **rmarkdown**. If, for some reason, rendering fails, you might need to also make sure the `fig.showtext` [option](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) is set to `TRUE`.

```r
# install.packages("showtext")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.showtext = TRUE)
```

**thematic** will do this for you when it's loaded (i.e., on `library(thematic)`), but that also means you can't start using **showtext** until the _next_ code chunk.

To use **ragg**'s png device instead, which in some environments (especially hosted ones) can produce higher quality and consistent output in less time (see [here](https://ragg.r-lib.org/) for more details), do the following in a setup code chunk:

```r
# install.packages("ragg")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")
```

Note that `dev = "ragg_png"` requires **knitr** v1.29 or higher (if you can't use that recent of a version you can also [set the device yourself](https://github.com/r-lib/ragg/issues/29))

## Auto detection in other output formats

Auto detecting in other output formats can in theory work if the output format sets `auto_config_set()`.
